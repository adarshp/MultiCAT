                      To what extent do you consider yourself to be a serious, competitive gamer? 
                      [Here we define "serious, competitive" as actively
                      training for and participating in competitive gameplay
                      more than a few times a year. Note that competitions may
                      take different forms depending on which game you play
                      competitively, some may be solo play, some may be teams of
                      players against teams of other players, some may be
                      structured as tournaments, but any competitive play that
                      results in identifiable winners and involves scheduled
                      and/or regular dedicated training or practice time is
                      appropriate to consider.]
